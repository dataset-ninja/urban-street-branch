**Tree Dataset of Urban Street: Branch** is a dataset for instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, object detection, and classification tasks. It is used in the environmental industry. 

The dataset consists of 1485 images with 1556 labeled objects belonging to 13 different classes including *branch_of_flowering_cherry*, *branch_of_lagerstroemia_indica*, *branch_of_prunus_cerasifera_f._atropurpurea*, and other: *branch_of_liriodendron_chinense*, *branch_of_zelkova_serrata*, *branch_of_magnolia_liliflora_desr*, *branch_of_styphnolobium_japonicum*, *branch_of_triadica_sebifera*, *branch_of_ginkgo_biloba*, *branch_of_koelreuteria_paniculata*, *branch_of_salix_babylonica*, *branch_of_platanus*, and *branch_of_albizia_julibrissin*.

Images in the Urban Street: Branch dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation (only one mask for every class) or object detection (bounding boxes for every object) tasks. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *train* (1193 images), *val* (149 images), and *test* (143 images). Also, the dataset includes ***classification_tag***. The dataset was released in 2022 by the <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">Zhejiang Agriculture and Forestry University</span>.
